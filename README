# WHAT IS JUDY?  (see below for list of top-level directories and files)
#
# Judy is a C library that implements a dynamic array.  Empty Judy arrays are
# declared with null pointers.  A Judy array consumes memory only when
# populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory.  Judy's key
# benefits are:  scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use.
# Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range,
# scaling near O(log-base-256).
#
# Judy arrays are accessed with insert, retrieve, and delete calls for number
# or string indexes.  Configuration and tuning are not required -- in fact not
# possible.  Judy offers sorting, counting, and neighbor/empty searching.
# Indexes can be sequential, clustered, periodic, or random -- it doesn't
# matter to the algorithm.  Judy arrays can be arranged hierarchically to
# handle any bit patterns -- large indexes, sets of keys, etc.
#
# Judy is often an improvement over common data structures such as:  arrays,
# sparse arrays, hash tables, B-trees, binary trees, linear lists, skiplists,
# other sort and search algorithms, and counting functions.
